Project Overview:

Scenario: A potential client seeks a loan for a used car.
Challenge: Banks traditionally base loan amounts on used car market value, a time-consuming and manual process.
Solution: Develop machine learning models that predict used car values based on various factors.
Target Audience: Potential car buyers and bank loan officers.
Technology Stack:
